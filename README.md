gripEditor
==========

A simple text editor with a grip handler to adjust the height by user.

Why another texteditor?<br/>
Because of the experience I would like to gain.

Implementation
==============

`$("#yourTextArea").gripEditor();`

TODO
====

Add more feautures like text size, color, etc which are required in a basic text editor.
